Ideas so far:
4K, 7K, EXPERT, BABYðŸ‘¶ (Replace with BGINER with naughtiness off), DUET

4K, 7K should be light gray

BABYðŸ‘¶ is cyan

EXPERT Should be dark pink
in case Erect gets replaced with the same name with naughtiness off

DUET is orange
3:04 PM 11/21/2024
BABYðŸ‘¶ (BGINER) and any difficulty that is easier than EASY are scrapped.

Text size of 50px doesn't look like base game's
Edit: 70px looks alright somewhat, but not what I want

Using the difficulty font doesn't work out, it has to be done by hand, which is very difficult for me, but let's see.
Mania is replaced with Insane. (EDIT 11/1/2025: Reason: Insane is more descriptive and accurate than Mania to the average player)
How it'd look: light orange with fire around the upper outlines of the text as the animation for it.

Had trouble drawing the letters due to using a mouse instead of a drawing tablet like everyone else and very minor hand twitching that messes up my accuracy, until a family member told me a tip, which is to draw every part of a letter with a straight line one at a time instead of drawing the whole letter in one go (draw then press SHIFT to make a straight line and CTRL for accurate angle)

Brush sizes: 8px for big letters, 6px for small
Outline guide: Select â†’ Grow by 5px

I made an Insane difficulty sprite that looks alright, I'd say,
but when I compared it to base game's the other day,
it looked... mechanical and not... handwritten like the original,
so I asked a family member about it and got told that
drawing with a mouse is hard in general,
and I should try to draw and animate on my phone or my school tablet instead of using
a mouse because at least you get more control just by using your fingers.
I think Ibis Paint had an update about animation, right? I'll check later

1:53 PM 12/14/2024
I checked, and yes it does support animation

Change of plans, we're doing it in Gimp again. Here is the "routine":
- Trace the outline of the original letters, not every letter is included in the original game, like K or U,
so I'll create the remaining ones by hand.

Ink tool (brush tool didn't work out) â†’ 3px
- Coloring:
  - Magic wand in the inner part of a letter
  - Make a layer meant for coloring the inner part of a letter
  - Select â†’ Grow â†’ 1px (or 2px)

Colors:
Duet

Insane
purple: HTML notation: 521452
dark purple: HTML notation: 110411

Realized that the purple color is used for Night,
so we're using a mix of bright orange and bright red as a gradient color

Nsane and Duet are done, so what's left is the cosmetic or extra difficulties that
are used in mods, including

Chill difficulty is a variation difficulty
if you have a chill version of a song
Color: green, blue? What represents peace or chill vibes?

4 Key, 7 Key, 9 Key
self-explanatory if you think about it for a bit
Color: gray

That's about it, I think?
INST ONLY maybe? But you might as well make a new song for that
as FNF songs' instrumental versions aren't meant to be played in the first place

Yeah, I think I'm satisfied with the extra ones
Chill, 4K, 7K, 9 Key

1:56 PM 1/29/2025
After doing Chill, I remembered that I needed an Edit difficulty,
which I just finished drawing. Pretty proud of it

Edit difficulty is an edited version of the chart
(what difficulty of the chart exactly is irrelevant when it comes to Edit as the rules are up to the charter),
VSRGs with .sm file support have this in their games

3:35 PM 1/29/2025
Okay, I'm finally done with all the difficulties I want to add
although later I decided not to include 9K at the end
due to its bigger rarity in FNF mods than 7K
I made sure to take one last look before I close down Gimp,
and I think it's safe to say I did alright, and I'm satisfied with the results
and it's in a state where I think it's complete
and doesn't demand too many post-launch updates
besides compatibility fixes and small touches
