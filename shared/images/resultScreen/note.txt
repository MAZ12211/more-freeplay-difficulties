I used Adobe Animate 2022 version,
opened up the flash file,
changed the colors via bucket tool,
as for picking the colors, it's just trial and error and see what fits,
exported as a png sequence,
opened up Gimp,
placed each letter next to each other manually, each letter
needs to have one space between them unlike the freeplay difficulty sprites
where each letter can barely have spaces and one letter has to be
squished to another letter in some cases,
Rotated all letters in -4.4 angle with noHalo interpolation to not
mess/change the antialiasing of the text to be pixelated,
export.
